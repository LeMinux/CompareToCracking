# CompareToCracking
I had an idea that if a comparision method returned the subtracted indecies directly that it could be used to crack passwords. Java compareTo() does this unlike C strcmp which just returns 0 or 1.

I have only tested with digits, but this can probably work (with some changes) if characters are involved.
